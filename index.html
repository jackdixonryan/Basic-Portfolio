            <p>I am Jack Ryan. I am a writer, a traveller, a lifelong learner
                and, with any luck, a soon-to-be full stack web designer. I 
                earned my BA at Kenyon College in rural Ohio, where I studied
                English with an emphasis on fiction writing, and minored in the
                Arabic language.<br><br>I am currently an associate at Amazon Fresh
                in North Denver, a facility that delivers fresh groceries throughout
                the city of Denver. I work in a hectic environment, which brings daily 
                challenges and lessons in unpredictability. <br><br>When I am neither working nor writing, I'm 
                often travelling. The photo to the left was taken in Iceland, at the 
                base of a waterfall which has an inscrutable name that I cannot remember.
                I found a tremendous deal of inspiration on our family's long ring 
                road trek around the island, where we saw everything from volcanic craters
                to growing iceberg lagoons.<br><br>My hobbies include skiing, hiking, and 
                brewing OK (though admittedly never top quality) beer with my cousin from
                our ever-increasing line of craft brews, Basement Brewing. So far, our 
                black IPA "Heart of Darkness" has been the pinnacle of our achievements.
