            <p>I am Jack Ryan--Traveller, writer, life-long student, 
               and budding coder. I write novels, shorts stories, 
               histories, articles, and hopefully soon, html and css.
               I am a creativity fanatic, constantly dedicating a large 
               portion of my time every day to writing, building, or 
               coding cool stuff. <br><br><br>The photo at left depicts one of the 
               infinite waterfall outflows in Iceland, one of the places 
               Where I have found the most ease.</p>
